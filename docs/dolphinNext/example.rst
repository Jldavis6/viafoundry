piPipes
=======

piPipes is a set of pipelines developed in the Zamore Lab and ZLab to analyze piRNA/transposon from different Next Generation Sequencing libraries such as small RNA-seq, RNA-seq, Genome-seq, ChIP-seq, CAGE/Degradome-Seq. Please see their Wiki pages (https://github.com/bowhan/piPipes/wiki) for the original content.

These pipelines are loaded to DolphinNext to facilitate their usage. An singularity image is provided (shub://UMMS-Biocore/piPipes_singularity) where all the neccessary programs are installed to execute the piPipes.
